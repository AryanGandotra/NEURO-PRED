By searching the keywords such as “neuropeptide” from UniProt/KB database and filtering these protein terms without the precursor of flags and the signal peptide, we collected 1194 complete reviewed precursors of neuropeptide. Here, we chose 31 test precursors as the independent test dataset which was integrated into the UniProt database after 2014. To guarantee a fair comparison on the independent test dataset, the collected sequences that are similar to the test precursors at a threshold of 40% using CD-HIT would be dropped. By the above steps, the remaining precursors from the training dataset included 717 precursors (training: validation=4:1).
