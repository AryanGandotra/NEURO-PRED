We mainly collected experimentally validated neuropeptides from the NeuroPep 2.0 database. A total of 11 282 experimentally validated neuropeptide sequences were obtained, of which 5333 sequences were newly added data in version 2.0. Then, a series of filter steps were adopted. First, neuropeptides with lengths between 5 and 100 were retained. Second, CD-HIT (version:4.8.1) [30] with a threshold of 0.9 was applied to the remaining samples to exclude the sequences that have more than 90% identity with other sequences. In data processing, the length of the neuropeptide (5â€“100) and the CD-HIT parameter (0.9) are consistent with the SOTA methods such as NeuroPred-FRL and PredNeuroP. After the above filtering steps, 4463 neuropeptides were still retained. To ensure a fair comparison, the independent neuropeptide test data were all from the newly added neuropeptides in NeuroPep 2.0, and 444 neuropeptides were randomly selected, accounting for 10% of the total 4463 neuropeptides. The screening method of negative samples was consistent with NeuroPred-FRL. Negative samples were extracted with a length distribution similar to the positive samples from the UniProt database [31], which resulted in 4463 negative samples. The non-neuropeptide test sets were randomly selected from the 4463 negative samples, and 444 sequences (10%) were randomly selected.
